Gluewine
========
Gluewine is a modular, aspect and service oriented framework created by Serge de Schaetzen, Formal and Knowledge Systems (fks). By using it, you will notice all the difficulties of classpath setups and import/exports of packages (OSGi) will disappear. Gluewine uses injection to “Glue” all the pieces together. This makes Gluewine a very user-friendly framework to use. If you want to set up the classpath, it simply works by adjusting the manifest-file or by adding a directory annotation.

By using the Gluewine-framework, working with hibernate becomes very simple. In only a few steps you are ready to interact with your database. It’s also possible to use different types of database systems like MySQL, PostgreSQL, H2,… There’s no need to change a lot of code when switching between two databases.

Gluewine also has an integration of Jetty, this make it possible for users to create servlets in a very easy way. There is no need for a separate xml-file. You can make your whole servlet in only one java-file. The same goes for RESTful webservices, with just a few steps you can make your own webservice by using Gluewine.

When you start working with Gluewine, you will notice there are also lots of other advantages like adding commands, the use of basic sessionmanagement, the use of authentication, and many more. If you want to find out about the rest of the functionalities of this powerful framework, you can check it out by downloading the code from this github repository.
