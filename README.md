Gluewine
========
Gluewine is a modular, aspect and service oriented framework created by Serge de Schaetzen, Formal and Knowledge Systems (fks). Using it, you will see all the difficulties of classpath setups and import/exports of packages (OSGi) disappear. Gluewine uses injection to “glue” all the pieces together. This makes Gluewine a very user-friendly framework. If you want to set up the classpath, it simply works by adjusting the manifestfile or by adding a directory annotation. 

When you use the Gluewine-framework, working with hibernate becomes very simple. In only a few steps you are ready to interact with your database. It is also possible to use different types of database systems like MySQL, PostgreSQL, H2, etcetera. There is no need to change a lot of code when switching between two databases. 

Gluewine also has an integration of Jetty. This make it possible for users to create servlets very easily. There is no need for a separate xml-file. You can make your whole servlet in only one Java-file. The same goes for RESTful web services; with just a few steps you can make your own web service using Gluewine. 

When you start working with Gluewine, you will notice there are also lots of other advantages like adding commands, the use of basic sessionmanagement, the use of authentication, and many more. If you want to find out about the rest of the functionalities of this powerful framework, you can check it out by downloading the code from this github repository.


In this package, you can find some examples of how to use hibernate, servlets, RESTful web service, etcetera. These can be found in the Gluewine/imp/examples folder. In our wiki-page on Github you can find an explanation about these examples. 
We also made an example application to help you understand the usage of Gluewine. With the documantation on wiki we will help you understand the different aspects of this application. This page can be found here: https://github.com/Gluewine/Gluewine/wiki/Example-application---Contactmanagement. On this page there is a link where you can download the package with the code for the example application.
